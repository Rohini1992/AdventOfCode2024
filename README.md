This repository contains my solution attempts with data
While I did not arrive at the correct answer for each question, this exercise has been a good way to practice clean coding with emphasis on data structures and complexity analysis.

General tips ->
1. I used python's native virtual environment manager `venv` using `Python: Create Environment` and activated via `.venv/source/activate`
2. I used pipreqs to create a requirements.txt file via `pipreqs solution_code/`
3. I created debugger config file `launch.json` via VS Code UI
